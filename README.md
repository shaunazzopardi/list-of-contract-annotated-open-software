# list-of-contract-annotated-open-software

In case studies for verification tools the authors/researchers end up creating the whole case studies completely (a program and a specification/property for it) or partially (a specification for an existing program). This is not ideal, given that this means that such case studies do not necessarily reflect real-world programs and/or specifications.

In an attempt to remedy this, here I am attempting to keep a list of open-source software that is already tagged/annotated by their developers with some form of specifications (pre- post-conditions and invariants mostly).
